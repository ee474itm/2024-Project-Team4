Gallagher and Burchenal cautiously adjust their path while Pettengill eagerly approaches it. It is approximately 100 yards away. At 50 yards, an indistinct form emerges. It appears as if the boundary and surrounding area are blurred and out of focus. As they approach 30 yards, the blurriness resolves into clarity. It is alive and subtly moving. They can see through it. At ten yards, they observe its undulating motion, slowly advancing towards them. It consumes the algae, its presence gradually spreading outward. And then they witness... A vast multitude of nematodes, tiny translucent worms. They relentlessly devour the algae, their progress irreversible. Pettengill cautiously extracts one using his entrenching tool. He examines it under the light. It is approximately three inches in length and slenderer than an earthworm. One end raises towards the sky, revealing a tri-part mouth with minute, crystalline teeth that open and close in search of sustenance. It is a captivating sight. Its true magnitude becomes apparent as they realize the sheer number of these creatures. The boundary has shifted closer by several inches as they stand there. They cautiously retreat, their voices still unable to form words."
